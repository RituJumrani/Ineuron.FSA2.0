Let's go through each question one by one:

1.
python
Copy code
>>> def func(a, b=6, c=8):
...     print(a, b, c)
>>> func(1, 2)
Result: 1 2 8

Explanation: In the function call func(1, 2), the value of a is set to 1, the value of b is set to 2 (overriding the default value of 6), and the default value of c (8) is used.

2.
python
Copy code
>>> def func(a, b, c=5):
...     print(a, b, c)
>>> func(1, c=3, b=2)
Result: 1 2 3

Explanation: In the function call func(1, c=3, b=2), the values of a, b, and c are explicitly specified, and they are printed accordingly.

3.
python
Copy code
>>> def func(a, *pargs):
...     print(a, pargs)
>>> func(1, 2, 3)
Result: 1 (2, 3)

Explanation: The *pargs syntax allows the function to accept a variable number of positional arguments. In this case, func(1, 2, 3) sets a to 1, and the remaining arguments (2 and 3) are collected into a tuple and assigned to pargs.

4.
python
Copy code
>>> def func(a, **kargs):
...     print(a, kargs)
>>> func(a=1, c=3, b=2)
Result: 1 {'c': 3, 'b': 2}

Explanation: The **kargs syntax allows the function to accept a variable number of keyword arguments. In this case, func(a=1, c=3, b=2) sets a to 1, and the keyword arguments b and c are collected into a dictionary and assigned to kargs.

5.
python
Copy code
>>> def func(a, b, c=8, d=5):
...     print(a, b, c, d)
>>> func(1, *(5, 6))
Result: 1 5 6 5

Explanation: The *(5, 6) syntax is used for unpacking the tuple. So, the function call is equivalent to func(1, 5, 6).

6.
python
Copy code
>>> def func(a, b, c):
...     a = 2; b[0] = 'x'; c['a'] = 'y'
...
>>> l = 1; m = [1]; n = {'a': 0}
>>> func(l, m, n)
>>> l, m, n
Result: (1, ['x'], {'a': 'y'})

Explanation: After the function call func(l, m, n), the values of l, m, and n are modified. l remains unchanged, m (which is a list) has its first element replaced with 'x', and n (which is a dictionary) has its 'a' key assigned the value 'y'.
