1.	The two values of the Boolean data type are True and False, and they are written as capitalized words.
2.	The three different types of Boolean operators are AND, OR, and NOT.
3.	Truth tables for each Boolean operator:
•	AND operator: True AND True = True True AND False = False False AND True = False False AND False = False
•	OR operator: True OR True = True True OR False = True False OR True = True False OR False = False
•	NOT operator: NOT True = False NOT False = True
4.	The values of the following expressions are:
•	(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) = False
•	not (5 > 4) = False
•	(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) = True
•	not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) = False
•	(True and True) and (True == False) = False
•	(not False) or (not True) = True
5.	The six comparison operators are:
•	Greater than (>)
•	Less than (<)
•	Equal to (==)
•	Not equal to (!=)
•	Greater than or equal to (>=)
•	Less than or equal to (<=)
6.	The equal to operator (==) is used to compare if two values are equal. The assignment operator (=) is used to assign a value to a variable. For example, if we want to check if x is equal to 5, we would use the condition "x == 5". If we want to assign the value 5 to x, we would use the statement "x = 5".
7.	The three blocks in the code are:
•	Block 1: spam = 0
•	Block 2: if spam == 10: print('eggs')
•	Block 3: if spam > 5: print('bacon') else: print('ham') print('spam') print('spam')


8.	if spam == 1:
    print('Hello')
elif spam == 2:
    print('Howdy')
else:
    print('Greetings!')

9.	If the program is stuck in an endless loop, you can press Ctrl + C to interrupt the execution and stop the program.
10.	The "break" statement is used to exit a loop entirely, while the "continue" statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.
11.	In a for loop, the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) is:
•	range(10) will iterate over the numbers 0 to 9.
•	range(0, 10) will also iterate over the numbers 0 to 9. The starting value (0) and step value (1) are optional and have default values.
•	range(0, 10, 1) will also iterate over the numbers 0 to 9 with a step size of 1. The starting value (0) and step value (1) are explicitly specified.
12.	Program using a for loop to print numbers 1 to 10:
             for num in range(1, 11):
              print(num)
Program using a while loop to print numbers 1 to 10:
             num = 1
              while num <= 10:
               print(num)
               num += 1 

13.	import spam
       spam.bacon()
