1. What does the dollar($) sign do?
In Excel, the dollar sign ($) is used to create an absolute reference in a cell reference. When you use the dollar sign before the column letter and/or row number in a cell reference, it indicates that the reference is absolute, and it will not change when you copy the formula to other cells. For example:
•	Relative Reference: A1 (changes when copied to other cells)
•	Absolute Reference: $A$1 (remains fixed when copied)
2. How to Change the Reference from Relative to Absolute (or Mixed)?
To change the reference from relative to absolute or mixed in Excel:
•	Absolute Reference:
•	Manually add the dollar sign ($) before the column letter and/or row number.
•	Example: $A$1
•	Mixed Reference (Column Absolute, Row Relative):
•	Add the dollar sign before the column letter only.
•	Example: $A1
•	Mixed Reference (Column Relative, Row Absolute):
•	Add the dollar sign before the row number only.
•	Example: A$1
3. Explain the order of operations in Excel?
The order of operations in Excel, commonly known as BIDMAS/BODMAS, follows the sequence:
1.	Brackets (Parentheses): Operations inside parentheses are performed first.
2.	Exponents (Orders): Exponential calculations.
3.	Division and Multiplication: From left to right.
4.	Addition and Subtraction: From left to right.
For example, in the formula =A1 + (B2 * C3) / D4^2, Excel will perform the operations in the order described.
4. What, according to you, are the top 5 functions in Excel and write a basic syntax for any of two?
Some top functions in Excel are:
1.	SUM:
•	Syntax: =SUM(number1, [number2], ...)
2.	VLOOKUP:
•	Syntax: =VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])
5. When would you use the SUBTOTAL function?
The SUBTOTAL function in Excel is used to perform calculations on a filtered range or database. It includes only the visible (unfiltered) rows in the calculation. You would use SUBTOTAL when you want to get a total, average, count, etc., considering only the visible data after applying filters.
6. What is the syntax of the VLOOKUP function? Explain the terms in it?
The syntax of the VLOOKUP function is:
excelCopy code
=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup]) 
•	lookup_value: The value to search for in the first column of the table_array.
•	table_array: The range that contains the data. It must include the column containing the lookup_value and the data to be retrieved.
•	col_index_num: The column number in the table_array from which to retrieve the value.
•	[range_lookup]: An optional argument. If TRUE or omitted, it assumes an approximate match; if FALSE, it searches for an exact match.
