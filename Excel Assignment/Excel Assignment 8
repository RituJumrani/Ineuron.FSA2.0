6. Extract first name and last name from the mail id and then from the address column, extract the city, state, and pin code using the flash fill. Given below is an example of the columns you have to create. Paste the screenshot of what you have created using the flash fill command. Example: Mail Id, Address, First name, Last name, State, City, Pincode
As a text-based platform, I'm unable to view or analyze screenshots. However, I can guide you through the steps:

Example Steps:

Mail Id Extraction:

Assume mail ids are in column A.
Create "First name" and "Last name" columns.
In the "First name" column, manually enter the first name of the first person.
In the "Last name" column, manually enter the last name of the first person.
Use Flash Fill to automatically fill the rest.
Address Extraction:

Assume addresses are in column B.
Create "City," "State," and "Pincode" columns.
Manually enter the city, state, and pin code of the first address.
Use Flash Fill to automatically fill the rest.
After setting up the initial data and applying Flash Fill, you should see Excel intelligently recognizing patterns and filling in the remaining data.
