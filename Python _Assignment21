Add the current date to the text file today.txt as a string.
python
Copy code
from datetime import datetime

current_date = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
with open("today.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write(current_date)
Read the text file today.txt into the string today_string.
python
Copy code
with open("today.txt", "r") as file:
    today_string = file.read()
Parse the date from today_string.
python
Copy code
parsed_date = datetime.strptime(today_string, "%Y-%m-%d")
List the files in your current directory.
python
Copy code
import os

current_directory = os.getcwd()
files_in_current_directory = os.listdir(current_directory)
Create a list of all the files in your parent directory (minimum five files should be available).
python
Copy code
parent_directory = os.path.dirname(current_directory)
files_in_parent_directory = os.listdir(parent_directory)[:5]
Use multiprocessing to create three separate processes. Make each one wait a random number of seconds between one and five, print the current time, and then exit.
python
Copy code
import multiprocessing
import time
import random

def print_current_time():
    wait_time = random.randint(1, 5)
    time.sleep(wait_time)
    current_time = time.strftime("%H:%M:%S", time.localtime())
    print(f"Process ID: {os.getpid()}, Current Time: {current_time}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    processes = []
    for _ in range(3):
        process = multiprocessing.Process(target=print_current_time)
        processes.append(process)
        process.start()

    for process in processes:
        process.join()
Create a date object of your day of birth.
python
Copy code
birth_date = datetime(year=1990, month=1, day=1)  # Replace with your actual birth date
What day of the week was your day of birth?
python
Copy code
day_of_week = birth_date.strftime("%A")
print(f"Day of the week of my birth: {day_of_week}")
When will you be (or when were you) 10,000 days old?
python
Copy code
ten_thousand_days_old = birth_date + timedelta(days=10000)
print(f"I will be (or was) 10,000 days old on: {ten_thousand_days_old.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}")
Make sure to customize the code where necessary, especially in task 7 where you need to replace the birth date with your actual birth date.
