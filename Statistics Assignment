Question 1:
Histogram Plot for the given data:

10, 13, 18, 22, 27, 32, 38, 40, 45, 51, 56, 57, 88, 90, 92, 94, 99 
You can create a histogram by grouping the data into bins and counting the frequency of observations in each bin. Here's a simple representation of the histogram:

Frequency | 10| ◆ 13| ◆ 18| ◆ 22| ◆ 27| ◆ 32| ◆ 38| ◆ 40| ◆ ◆ 45| ◆ ◆ 51| ◆ ◆ 56| ◆ ◆ 57| ◆ ◆ 88| ◆ ◆ 90| ◆ ◆ 92| ◆ ◆ 94| ◆ ◆ 99| ◆ ◆ 
Question 2:
80% Confidence Interval Calculation:
Given data:
•	Population Standard Deviation (σ) = 100
•	Sample Mean (x̄) = 520
•	Sample Size (n) = 25
•	Confidence Level = 80%
The formula for the Confidence Interval (CI) is: CI=�ˉ±�(��)CI=xˉ±Z(nσ)
CI=520±�(10025)CI=520±Z(25100)
You need to find the Z-value for the 80% confidence level. Consult a Z-table or use a statistical calculator to find it.
Question 3:
Hypothesis Testing:
Null Hypothesis (H0): �≤0.60p≤0.60 (The percentage of citizens owning a vehicle is 60% or less) Alternate Hypothesis (H1): �>0.60p>0.60 (The percentage of citizens owning a vehicle is more than 60%)
Given data:
•	Surveyed residents = 250
•	Residents owning a vehicle (Yes responses) = 170
•	Significance Level (α) = 10%
You will perform a hypothesis test, possibly using the z-test for proportions, to determine if there's enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
Question 4:
99th Percentile Calculation:
Given data: 2,2,3,4,5,5,5,6,7,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,10,11,11,122,2,3,4,5,5,5,6,7,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,10,11,11,12
To find the 99th percentile, arrange the data in ascending order and identify the value below which 99% of the data falls.
Question 5:
Relationship in Left & Right-Skewed Data:
•	In left-skewed (negatively skewed) data:
•	Mean < Median < Mode
•	In right-skewed (positively skewed) data:
•	Mode < Median < Mean
Graphical representation:

Left-Skewed Right-Skewed /\ /\ / \ / \ / \ / \ ___/ \__________________/ \_____ 
In left-skewed data, the tail is on the left, pulling the mean to the left of the median. In right-skewed data, the tail is on the right, pulling the mean to the right of the median. The mode is influenced by the direction of skewness.
