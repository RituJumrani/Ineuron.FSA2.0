[] represents an empty list in Python.

To assign the value 'hello' as the third value in the list stored in the variable spam, you would use the following code:

python
Copy code
spam[2] = 'hello'
The value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)] is 'd'.

The value of spam[-1] is the last element of the list, which is 'd'.

The value of spam[:2] is a sublist containing the first two elements of spam, i.e., ['a', 'b'].

The value of bacon.index('cat') is 1. The index method returns the first index at which the specified value appears in the list.

bacon.append(99) adds the value 99 to the end of the list in bacon.

bacon.remove('cat') removes the first occurrence of 'cat' from the list in bacon.

The list concatenation operator is +, and the list replication operator is *.

The append() method adds a value to the end of the list, while the insert() method inserts a value at a specified index in the list.

The two methods for removing items from a list are remove() and pop(). The remove() method removes the first occurrence of a specified value, and the pop() method removes an element at a specified index (or the last element if no index is specified) and returns it.

Both list values and string values are ordered sequences of elements. Each element in both lists and strings has an index, and both support indexing, slicing, and iteration.

Tuples and lists are both sequence data types, but the main difference is that lists are mutable (can be modified), whereas tuples are immutable (cannot be modified once created).

To type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42, you would use parentheses:

python
Copy code
my_tuple = (42,)
To get a list value's tuple form, you can use the tuple() constructor:

python
Copy code
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_tuple = tuple(my_list)
To get a tuple value's list form, you can use the list() constructor in a similar way.

Variables that "contain" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, they contain references or pointers to the list objects.

copy.copy() creates a shallow copy of a list (copies the top-level elements but not nested objects), while copy.deepcopy() creates a deep copy (copies all elements, including nested objects). Shallow copies may still reference the same nested objects, whereas deep copies create completely independent copies of all objects, including nested ones.
