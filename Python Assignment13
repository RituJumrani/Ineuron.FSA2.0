What advantages do Excel spreadsheets have over CSV spreadsheets?

Excel spreadsheets have some advantages over CSV spreadsheets, including:

Formatting: Excel supports rich formatting options, such as font styles, colors, and cell merging, which CSV does not.
Formulas and Functions: Excel allows the use of formulas and functions, making it suitable for complex calculations, while CSV only stores plain data.
Multiple Sheets: Excel files can have multiple sheets, providing a way to organize and structure data more effectively.
What do you pass to csv.reader() and csv.writer() to create reader and writer objects?

For csv.reader(), you pass a file object or any iterable object containing CSV-formatted data.

python
Copy code
import csv
with open('example.csv', 'r') as file:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(file)
For csv.writer(), you pass a file object and optionally specify the delimiter and other formatting options.

python
Copy code
import csv
with open('output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    csv_writer = csv.writer(file)
What modes do File objects for reader and writer objects need to be opened in?

For reader objects: 'r' (read mode)
For writer objects: 'w' (write mode)
What method takes a list argument and writes it to a CSV file?

The writerow() method of the csv.writer object is used to write a list of values to a CSV file.

python
Copy code
csv_writer.writerow(['Value1', 'Value2', 'Value3'])
What do the keyword arguments delimiter and line terminator do?

delimiter: Specifies the character used to separate fields in a CSV file. The default is a comma (,).
lineterminator: Specifies the character used to terminate lines in the CSV file. The default is '\r\n' on Windows and '\n' on other platforms.
Example:

python
Copy code
csv_writer = csv.writer(file, delimiter='\t', lineterminator='\n')
What function takes a string of JSON data and returns a Python data structure?

The json.loads() function is used to parse a JSON-formatted string and return a Python data structure.

python
Copy code
import json
python_data = json.loads(json_string)
What function takes a Python data structure and returns a string of JSON data?

The json.dumps() function is used to serialize a Python data structure into a JSON-formatted string.

python
Copy code
import json
json_string = json.dumps(python_data)
