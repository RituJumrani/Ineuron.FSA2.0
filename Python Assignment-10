1.	shutil.copy() is used to copy a single file, while shutil.copytree() is used to copy an entire directory tree, including all of its contents.
2.	The os.rename() function is used to rename files.
3.	The delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules differ in their behavior:
•	send2trash module's send2trash() function moves files and folders to the system's trash or recycle bin, allowing for recovery.
•	shutil module's shutil.rmtree() function deletes an entire directory tree permanently, and shutil.remove() deletes a single file permanently.
4.	The ZipFile method equivalent to File objects' open() method is ZipFile() itself. You create a ZipFile object by calling ZipFile(filename, mode), where filename is the name of the ZIP file, and mode is the mode in which to open the file (e.g., 'r' for reading or 'w' for writing).
5.	Here is an example program in Python that searches for files with a specific file extension in a folder tree and copies them to a new folder:
import os
import shutil

def copy_files_with_extension(source_folder, destination_folder, file_extension):
    if not os.path.exists(destination_folder):
        os.makedirs(destination_folder)

    for foldername, subfolders, filenames in os.walk(source_folder):
        for filename in filenames:
            if filename.endswith(file_extension):
                source_path = os.path.join(foldername, filename)
                destination_path = os.path.join(destination_folder, filename)
                shutil.copy(source_path, destination_path)
                print(f'Copied: {filename} from {source_path} to {destination_path}')

# Example usage
source_folder = '/path/to/source_folder'
destination_folder = '/path/to/destination_folder'
file_extension = '.pdf'  # Change this to the desired file extension
copy_files_with_extension(source_folder, destination_folder, file_extension)
Make sure to replace /path/to/source_folder and /path/to/destination_folder with the actual paths of your source and destination folders.
