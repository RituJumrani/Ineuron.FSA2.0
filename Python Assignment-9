1.	A relative path refers to the location of a file or directory in relation to the current working directory.
2.	An absolute path on most operating systems starts with the root directory. For example, on Windows, it might start with a drive letter like C:\, and on Unix-based systems, it might start with /.
3.	
•	os.getcwd(): This function returns the current working directory as a string.
•	os.chdir(path): This function changes the current working directory to the specified path.
4.	
•	. represents the current directory.
•	.. represents the parent directory.
5.	In the path C:\bacon\eggs\spam.txt:
•	The directory name (dir name) is C:\bacon\eggs.
•	The base name is spam.txt.
6.	The three "mode" arguments that can be passed to the open() function are:
•	'r': Read mode.
•	'w': Write mode (creates a new file or overwrites existing content).
•	'a': Append mode (appends to the end of the file).
7.	If an existing file is opened in write mode ('w'), the file's existing content is truncated, and the file is essentially cleared before any new data is written.
8.	
•	read(): Reads the entire content of the file as a single string.
•	readlines(): Reads the content of the file line by line and returns a list of strings, where each string represents a line.
9.	A shelf value in Python (using the shelve module) resembles a dictionary data structure. It allows you to store and retrieve key-value pairs, providing a persistent storage solution for Python objects.
